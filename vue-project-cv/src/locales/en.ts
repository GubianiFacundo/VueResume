    description: `Hi, I'm Facundo Geranio Gubiani, a passionate software developer from Argentina.

This project, "Vue-Resume", is my take on what a modern, interactive resume can be — blending design, code, and creativity to tell my story in a more dynamic way.
Here, you'll not only find my professional background and skills, but also get a real-time demonstration of my work in action.

Everything you see was built from scratch using Vue.js, and it's more than just a resume — it's a living, evolving portfolio that reflects who I am as a developer.

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore and reach out if you'd like to connect!`
