# VueResume

A full-stack project for building a professional resume using **Vue.js** for the frontend and **NestJS** for the backend.

## ðŸ“„ About This Project
This project was created as a way to showcase my skills as a professional software developer. My goal was to demonstrate the breadth and depth of what Iâ€™ve learned over the years, while maintaining a minimal and clean implementation. The result is this interactive resume â€” a personal project that blends practical design with technical precision.

While I followed best practices and industry standards throughout the build, youâ€™ll also notice some custom-built components and features that reflect my unique approach and problem-solving style.

## ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s Included
I aimed to integrate everything I could think of that represents a modern, full-stack application. Here's a breakdown of the technologies and tools used:

### Frontend
+ **Vue.js 3** with the Composition API (setup syntax)

+ **Vite** for fast and optimized development

+ **Vitest** for unit testing

+ **Pinia** as the state management library

+ **Vuetify** for UI components

+ **Cypress** for E2E testing

+ Various related libraries and components

### Backend
+ **NestJS** as the backend framework

+ **Jest** for backend unit and integration tests

+ **TypeORM** for database interactions

Other common backend tools and libraries

### DevOps / Deployment
+ **Docker** for containerization

+ **Nginx** for reverse proxy and serving static content

+ Deployed on an **AWS cluster**, fully containerized and scalable

  DATABASE_NAME=your_database
```

3 - Run database migrations:
  This should create DB, Create Tables, and populate them.

```bash
  npm run migrate
```

4 - Start the backend server:

```bash
  npm run start:dev
```

#### Frontend Setup
